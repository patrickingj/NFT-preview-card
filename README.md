## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While building this project, I learned; how to resize images using widths and height, the difference between hover, active and focus states, how to overlay an image or background on top of another one, how to set and use CSS variables, and I also learned how to update my code on GitHub.

### Continued development

I want to learn more about CSS custom variables and what I can do with them,how to build better responsive and accessible websites, and how to style images better and animations. There's so much I have to learn.

### Useful resources
